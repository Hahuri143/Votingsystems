    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs </li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Mix together vanilla instant pudding mix, cream and milk. Cover and refrigerate to set.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring water and butter to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour and salt until the mixture forms a ball.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon or stand mixer, beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each.</li>
        <li>Drop by tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet, spacing them a couple of inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Centers should be dry.</li>
        <li>When the shells are cool, either split and fill them with the pudding mixture, or use a pastry bag to pipe the pudding into the shells.</li>
